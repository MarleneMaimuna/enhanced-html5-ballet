# Ballet Enrollment Form

Hello! In this project, I created a simple HTML5 web page for enrolling in a ballet school. My goal was to practice and apply advanced HTML5 features, especially using lists, tables, media, and forms.

I organized the content with ordered and unordered lists to make the information clear and easy to follow. I also built a simple table to showcase different ballet styles, using proper semantic structure.

I included media elements like a ballerina photo, classical music audio, and a related video, all using native HTML5 tags without relying on external scripts or CSS.

For the enrollment form, I used various input types with native HTML5 validation such as required fields, patterns, and length limits to ensure users enter valid information. The form is divided into sections with fieldsets and legends to improve accessibility.

This project helped me strengthen my skills in creating well-structured, accessible, and functional web pages using only HTML5, without CSS or JavaScript.

Hope you enjoy it!
